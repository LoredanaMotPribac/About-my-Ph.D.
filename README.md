The influence of human capital on economic growth within  the European Union 

Keywords: human capital, education, economic growth.

The scientific novelty of the topic studied derives from the comparative approach of the special importance of human capital on the economic growth and the highlight of the best dimensions of education in the extended area of the European Union. The research method is based both on the neoclassical perspective of growth models and on the new endogenous theories of growth which incorporate the development of human capital as a key element in creating progress.
